# Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship - Task 1

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains my solution for **Task 1** of the Data Science Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**. The goal of this task was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by visualizing the distribution of a specific variable within a dataset.

## 📊 Task Description
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

## 🗃️ Dataset
I utilized the **World Bank Population Dataset**, which provides historical population data for countries and regions globally.
* **Source:** [World Bank Open Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL)

## 🛠️ Key Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Cleaned the dataset by removing metadata and non-country entities (e.g., "World", "Upper middle income").
   - Transposed and reshaped the data for easier time-series or cross-sectional analysis.
3. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - Checked for null entries to ensure visualization accuracy.
5. **Visualization:**
   - Used **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create a distribution plot.
   - Customized the charts for better readability (labels, titles, and color palettes).

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (Data Manipulation)
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Google Colab** (Development Environment)

## 💡 Insights
The visualization clearly shows the disparity in population sizes across different nations, highlighting the high-density outliers and the general distribution curve of global demographics.
